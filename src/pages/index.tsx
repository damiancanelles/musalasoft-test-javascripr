      Greetings, I am a backend developer, I have not had time to finish the front end of the application for the delivery time, I have left in the readme the instructions to do the deployment and inside the folder a file with the insomnia collection to test the api , I have also added some unit tests that will facilitate the work, the instructions to use them are also in the readme. Thank you for the opportunity.
